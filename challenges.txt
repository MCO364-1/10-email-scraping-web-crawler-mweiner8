Avi Weiner Challenges and Decisions:

- The main part of the crawler is a Queue which has the websites to visit and because it's a queue, I use a breadth-first search.
    To ensure that I don't visit a website that I already visited, I have one Set keep track of ones that are already visited and I check
    everything against that Set before entering it into the queue. I also have a Set which has the same data as the Queue, so I can know
    if something will be entered into the Queue twice and I can prevent that.

- I know that there are many domains for websites and emails, but through my testing I saw that there are a lot of things that have the
    same structure as a website or email address but aren't (such as an image) so to try to limit my results I configured my Regex to only
    check for the common domains of .com, .org, .gov, .net, and .edu.

- To save database connections I enter all the emails into the database in one command at the end of the program

- To ensure consistent data, I convert everything to all lowercase before saving it

- I put in some extra 'catch' statements to get some variety and specificity with the error messages received with certain urls that
    either don't exist or don't work with Jsoup. (I've noticed that X never works. It gives a 400 error.)

- I had to add a shutdown and awaitTermination to attempt to close the open threads once I have the desired number of emails
